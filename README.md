## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript for content animation
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Snapping Scroll Effect with CSS

### What I learned

- Learn how to use setInterval method in JavaScript, combine with the toggle method to toggle animation
- Using CSS property 'mix-blend-mode: difference' to blend the element's content with the parent content and parent background, which enabled me to change the color of the logo based on current background color 
- Spend about 2 days to plan, set up the files and structures, code the components of the website, and finish the mockup of the website

### Useful resources

- [animation - CSS Tricks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations)
- [mix-blend-mode - Kevin Powell](https://codepen.io/daveredfern/pen/zBGBJV)(https://youtu.be/wLPIwZdo0gM)
- [Alternate navbar with the sibling selector - article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator)
- [Add sound effect when click - wesbos JS30 first Drumkit challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/)

### What to improve next time?

- Mainly the cleanliness of the code itself. Code can be refactored, especially the CSS parts! (I believe I wrote tons of repetitive code ðŸ˜­ )
  - What to do?: View other people's code, see how they structured and organize their code, and implement their styles into yours!
